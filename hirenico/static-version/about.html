                    <h2 class="card-title">My Journey</h2>
                    <div class="card-content">
                        <p>I am currently a Senior Process Engineer at Tesla with a strong background in leading 
                            cross-functional projects, optimizing operations, and delivering measurable results. 
                            Over the course of my career, I’ve driven initiatives that improved efficiency, reduced 
                            costs, and built collaborative team environments. My experience managing complex systems 
                            and problem-solving at scale naturally led me to pursue software development as a way 
                            to expand my ability to design impactful, data-driven solutions.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Currently, I am completing my Master’s in Software Development, where I’ve built expertise
                             in full-stack web development, cloud services, and modern frameworks. My projects range
                              from interactive web applications to backend systems integrating databases, APIs, and 
                              AWS cloud infrastructure. This technical foundation, paired with my process engineering
                               experience, allows me to approach software with both a strategic and hands-on 
                               perspective—delivering solutions that are robust, scalable, and user-focused.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I am passionate about leveraging both my engineering and software development 
                            skills to build tools that streamline processes, improve decision-making, and 
                            create meaningful user experiences.</p>
